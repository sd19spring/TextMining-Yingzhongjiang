    "Project Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I used Gutenberg for my data.\n",
    "Specifically the ten tragedies by Shakespeare.\n",
    "The goal for my project is to find common trends in sentiment\n",
    "by act within the playsself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "After downloading files from Gutenberg, my mini-project focuses\n",
    "on two primary functions: reshuffling Shakespeare's work into\n",
    "a format that can be sentiment analyzed by act, and then importing\n",
    "nltk to analyze the acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One design decision is seen in the beginning of the code,\n",
    "where split is not by the traditional \" \". This ironically took\n",
    "many days (about 3 to 4) of iterating and staring at my computer\n",
    "wondering if I made a good decision. Original iterations involved\n",
    "creating a list seperated into acts; I fiddled with creating empty\n",
    "lists and noodling the txt files through for loops to\n",
    "ultimately append to said empty lists. However thanks to a strike of\n",
    "inspiration from unknown source in the middle of coding alone in a dark room,\n",
    "I was able to find a simpler version, and decided to just do\n",
    "str.split(\"ACT\"). It was blissfully shorter, and thus my choice on\n",
    "adopting it for my project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "This Reflection will be sent along with other files. One such file is a\n",
    "plotted graph of the sentiment over acts. Within the graph, it was\n",
    "particularly interesting to realize that Shakespearian tragedies are,\n",
    "at least to a modern computer, not tragic. Furthermore, over each of the\n",
    "five acts within each play, the compound sentiment is very consistent and\n",
    "hovers around a 1.0. The attached image of the plotted graph had its y-axis\n",
    "values were adjusted to 1.0 and 0.999 to show slight variances among plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other interesting find is in addition to each act within a play having\n",
    "minimal variance in sentiment, thus creating a straight line parallel to the\n",
    "x-axis, each play has a very minimal overall sentiment variance when compared\n",
    "to other plays. The attached image of the plotted graph had its y-axis\n",
    "values were adjusted to 1.0 and 0.999 to show slight variances among plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fair amount of alignment between what I set out to explore, the data,\n",
    "and the tools used to carry out the project. Although it was dissappointing todo\n",
    "see minimal variance over act of a Shakespearian tragedy, it was very interesting\n",
    "to find that Shakespeare was able to maintain an overall consistent level\n",
    "of sentiment throughout each play.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project came to be from talking with Ashley and a few other classmates on\n",
    "tentative ideas for potential project work. Originally it was to find if\n",
    "sentiment of Disney movies changed over time, especially with its acquisition\n",
    "of Pixar. Thanks to Melissa, I was saved from diving too deep into a murky place of\n",
    "legal issues pertaining to copyright, and chose to redirect myself to the word\n",
    "of creators to whom society deemed \"legally dead in all forms but still important\":\n",
    "Gutenberg.com \n",
    "\n",
    "I imagined my data would reveal the key to writing great, timeless tragic plays through\n",
    "the use of careful sentiment alterations by act within a play. And this would be one\n",
    "of the many leads into recreating timeless classics. Thankfully Shakespeare wrote\n",
    "a limited number of tragedies, so data collection was not as bad. However, because\n",
    "each edition of his plays are always tweaked for our understanding, there could be\n",
    "content lost to translation. Furthermore, the tools were able to do the work and achieve\n",
    "the goal they were set out to achieve, and the only flaw found would perhaps be in\n",
    "the coder herself. Due to time limitations, Anne decided to simply focus on plays by\n",
    "act and not further break Shakespeare's works into each scene; this\n",
    "could potentially distort our results, and accordingly, potentially give room for error\n",
    "in Anne's confidence in her discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "What went well: the main idea, finding the results in sentiment differences by act.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could I improve: break plays down into scenes and then use sentiment analysis, incorporate\n",
    "more sentiment analysis data and not just the compound value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigate problems: ask for help more, and Google everything much\n",
    "earlier in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe my project was well scoped. Because Shakespeare only wrote ten plays, and\n",
    "each play only has five acts, it was relatively enjoyable when coding and\n",
    "testing my work. Going forward, I have learned that Google is one of my best friends,\n",
    "should ask for help much earlier than I would think, and don't stress out when\n",
    "the code isn't going my way. Before I started, I wish I knew that I should choose\n",
    "my project idea very early, and in general start everything earlier. And I wish\n",
    "I could have told my past self to not be afraid to ask for help.\n",
